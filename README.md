# Chango

Presto! Chango! A tool for calculating your PRESTO tax claim amount.

## The Goal

To claim a tax credit for transit costs, the Canadian Revenue Agency requires that you take at least 32 trips in a consecutive 31 day period in order to claim the costs for that periods. PRESTO provides a Transit Usage Report detailing the trips paid for with your PRESTO card over the year. Unfortunately, this report is provided as a PDF summarizing the trip counts and costs for each transit agency on a week-by-week basis. This makes it difficult to calculate how much you can claim when filing your taxes.

Chango's goal is to make calculating that claim amount easy.

## How It Works

You provide your PRESTO Transit Usage Report PDF and Chango collates the dates, trip counts and trip costs, analyzes the collated data and determines which 4-week periods can be claimed to achieve the largest tax credit possible.
